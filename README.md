## How to set up and run the project locally through a NodeJS Server:
1. Extract the folder from the zipped file.
2. Open Command Prompt.
3. Naviate to the project project (using the cd command) 
(i.e. the main folder containing the file app.js)
4. Run the command in order to install all the modules needed in order to run the project successfully:
```
npm install 
```
5. We may now run the server by typing ```node app.js```
6. Since the web application is running on localhost:3000, type ```http://localhost:3000``` on your browser of choice.
7. Now, do not forget to sign up to access all the features of the application!
